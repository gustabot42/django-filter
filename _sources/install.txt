Installing django-filter
------------------------

Install with pip:

.. code-block:: bash

        pip install django-filter

And then add ``'django_filters'`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS``.

.. note::

    django-filter provides *some* localization for *some* languages. If you do
    not need these translations (or would rather provide your own), then it is
    unnecessary to add django-filter to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.
